This is our final project; it uses DJango, to install, use "pip install django" from the command line in PyCharm.

To run, right click on "manage.py" and select "Run 'manage'". It will give you a list of options; near the top, by the run button, click the drop down that says "manage", and select "Edit configuration." In the window that pops up, put "runserver" in the Parameters box. You will only have to do this once.

When the server starts up, it will give you an error in the web browser; to fix this, just put "products" at the end of the url, so it will look something like: "http://127.0.0.1:8000/products".

Current progress:
Main page that shows products works
Add product page works (probably need input validation)
The button to add items to cart works
The screen to view the shopping cart works
When you click "Place order" in the shopping cart screen, the cart is cleared and a message is displayed.
Search works
Adding items to cart and specifying quantity works
Calculating and displaying the total price works

I'm working on the page to view the cart.

Please see the screenshots folder for current progress.

Please see plan.txt for what we should implement.
